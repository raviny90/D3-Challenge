# D3-Challenge

Welcome to this project using the D3 techniques we learned, 

* I created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements and created and situated axes , labels to the left and bottom of the chart . 
* Using more demographics and more risk factors placed additional labels in scatter plot and gave them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. 
* Animated the transitions for circles' locations as well as the range of axes and implemented D3-tip.
